# Overview
This repository is includes the code I created to program an electronic LED clock.

For the final project for my ESE 123: Introduction to Electrical and Computer Engineering class, I built a LED Clock, programmed using AVR Assembly, with the help of my professor. 

# What can it do?
The clock acts as a time-keeping devices and displays time through a four-digit seven-segment display. It is, also, able to act as a charger as it is able to connect to a device through it's USB port. The clock meets USB specifications of a continuous +5V, as outlined by Underwriters' Laboratories, and thus, it won't damage your phone's battery. 

# Final Thoughts
Good alternative to quick charging, which drains battery longevity.
