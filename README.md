# LED Clock
A LED clock built using the AVR Assembly language for my ESE 123: Introduction to Electrical and Computer Engineering class. 

The clock acts as a time-keeping devices and displays time through a four-digit seven-segment display. It is, also, able to act as a charger as it is able to connect to a device through it's USB port. The clock meets USB specifications of a continuous +5V. 

Good alternative to quick charging, which drains battery longevity.
